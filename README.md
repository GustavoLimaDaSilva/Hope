Built With
React

Typescript

TanStack

Zustand

Express

Additional Dependencies
ImageKit.io (to store and deliver images and videos)

Challenges
As a front-end developer, I do not yet have the expertise required to design and manage a production-ready database. For this reason, the application currently relies on JSON files as mock data.

I am still looking for free and legal sources of listening content suitable for language learning.
